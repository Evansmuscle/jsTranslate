## Hello! This is jsTranslate!

Just put your JSON data in english in the data folder, and when you start the script from index.js, the translations as a JSON file will be outputted to the output folder, it's as simple as that! You can change the language options from the index.js file! This translator uses puppeteer to go to the DeepL website, and translate everything from there!
